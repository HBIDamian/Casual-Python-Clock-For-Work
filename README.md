# Casual Python Clock For Work

## What is this?
This is a simple clock application that displays the current time in a 24-hour format.

I created this application for work, as I needed a clock that would display the current time in a 24-hour format that I can easily glance at, at any size, and at any time.

I also wanted to experiment with Python. I had help from ChatGPT to guide me through the process of creating this application too. 

## Modules used:
You may need to install the following module(s) to run the application:
- [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)

## To start the clock:
```
python3 ./RunClock.py
```
