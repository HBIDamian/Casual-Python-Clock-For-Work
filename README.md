It shows green when running, red when stopped, and white when reset.

- tkinter

## Features

## Why did I make this?
I previously made an attempt that worked for a while. But when MacOS updated to Sequoia, the application stopped working. I decided to make a new one now that I have a better understanding of Python. With help from ChatGPT, of course.
